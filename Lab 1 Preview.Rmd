This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. [Note: This first section is sample code that you'll see any time you create a new R Markdown Notbook. You can safely delete it to have a blank notebook.]

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
**We're going to start by loading some data!** This is actually the same data that produced the plot above. It's available in an R packgage, called "cars," but we want to practice loading it from a file. 

We'll use two methods. The first is the *base R* method, you can use with just the minimum R installation. 

With the base R method, we first clear the *Global Environment*, then set a *working directory*. You may have heard directories referred to as "folders." A directory refers to a specific section of your computer's disk drive, the permanent storage that remains even if you turn the computer off. 

```{r}
#This is a comment
#Comments can go on their own line, or after a line of actual code

rm(list = ls()) #this clears the Global Environment

setwd("~/3 - R Studio Projects/pols3316-summer2022") #This sets the working directory
#setwd("/cloud/project") #This sets the working directory
```

With the working directory set, we're ready to actually load the data. The next line of code actually does multiple things. 

First, we create a new *object* called "cars_data".

Then the *assignment operator* **<-** tells R to assign whatever is to the right of it to the new object to the left of the <-. (For those of you with *python* experience, this is the same as the = in python.)

Last, *read.csv* is an R *command* that tells R to read the file we specify. 

```{r}
cars_data <- read.csv("./data/cars.csv") 
```

This is not the preferred method for working with data.  With the working directory method, if you run my script on your computer it probably won't work. The reason is that your directory structure is unique to your computer. For example, I have all my R work in a directory called "~/3 - R Studio Projects/" which you almost certainly don't have on your computer. 

Second, we don't want to set a working directory since the *R Studio Project*, which we'll discuss more later, does this for us. R Studio Projects, especially when used with *Github*, provide a much better organized way of handling your work with the added bonus of a simple way to backup your work to the cloud.

[Jenny Bryan, an R Studio developer and educator,](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) takes this so seriously that she said: 

> If the first line of your R script is

> setwd("C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have")

> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.

> If the first line of your R script is

> rm(list = ls())

> I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE ðŸ”¥.


The recommended method is to use an R *package* called *here*. A *package* is really just a collection of pre-written code that someone has produced to do specific things in R. The *here* package is intended to help organize loading and storing data. With *here*, you specify the directory in the command and it is always *relative* to the current directory - no need to name the current directory or to set a working directory. For example, in the following code, the data is in a subdirectory (or subfolder) called "data".

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #this clears the Global Environment
#uncomment the following line the first time to install the "here" #package
#install.packages("here")

library("here") #This loads the here package
cars_data2 <- read.csv(here("data","cars.csv"))
```





[Edit the following is part of the default Notebook code. You can delete it in your own notebooks.]

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
